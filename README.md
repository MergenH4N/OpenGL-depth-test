# OpenGL ES 2.0 - glDepthFunc Test Application

This project is a simple C application designed to visually demonstrate how depth testing (`glDepthTest`) works in OpenGL ES 2.0 and how different 
parameters passed to the `glDepthFunc` function affect the rendering result.

## Project Purpose
Depth testing is a fundamental technique used in 3D graphics to determine which objects are in front of or behind others. The `glDepthFunc` function 
defines the rule used for this test. This application provides a live example to test each of these rules.
